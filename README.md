# Description:

On this project, I will be rebuilding the homepage of the Bose website [Bose Homepage](https://www.bose.com/en_us/index.html). The homepage will be divided into the following components:

* Header: top navigation menu
* Hero Image
* Recommended: products
* Bose Home (not ready)
* Bose Noise (not ready)
* Sunglasses (not ready)
* BOSE AUTOMOTIVE (not ready)
* Footer: Social Media (not ready)
* Footer: Sign up form (not ready)
* Footer Links (not ready)
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.5.
